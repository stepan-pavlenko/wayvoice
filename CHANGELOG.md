# Changelog

## 0.6.11 — 2026-10-11

- Run native package updates inside the app, with progress, retry, service verification and automatic interface restart. Flatpak and source installations show their own update route.
- Compact the Status card and add shortcuts for copying the last dictation and opening Settings.
- Respect the system message language in automatic UI selection and localize disabled shortcut labels.
- Prevent late cancellation from sending paste keys, distinguish copying from insertion, and preserve Unicode sentence endings.
- Bound external recognizer output and diagnostic buffers.
- Require GTK tests before release publication and isolate RPM build workspaces.

## 0.6.10 — 2026-10-11

- Removed empty shortcut hints and reduced spacing in the dictation card.
- Made first-dictation guidance collapsible; it folds once after recognized text and respects manual reopening.
- Updated Linux package descriptions and added English screenshots to AppStream metadata.
- Prevented native package updates from overlapping Faster-Whisper runtime preparation, including direct setup requests and daemon startup.

## 0.6.9 — 2026-10-11

- Added first-run setup for interface language and a local model, with explicit preparation, cancellation, retry and deferral.
- Added KDE Plasma shortcut configuration through a daemon-owned GlobalShortcuts portal, with actual binding feedback and a manual fallback.
- Made the status indicator compact and draggable, with desktop window actions for Keep Above where supported.
- Added explicit GitHub Release updates for installed DEB/RPM packages: checksum and metadata checks, installation-time recording protection, service restart and daemon version verification.
- Expanded the interface to ten languages: English, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Arabic and Hindi. Added Arabic RTL layout and bundled offline translations.
- Fixed settings width, active-engine language handling, invalid configuration recovery, daemon restart ownership, package-removal cleanup and bundled input-helper edge cases.
- Updated the README and contribution guidance, added English UI screenshots, and added GTK UI checks to CI.

Installed self-update, complete KDE dictation/paste and Flatpak desktop acceptance remain pending. This is an alpha release; automated checks do not establish support for every desktop.

## 0.6.8 — 2026-10-10

- Fedora RPM explicitly requires the Cairo introspection provider so GTK/Adwaita can load on minimal installations.

- Simplified UI background completions and cleared obsolete engine error tooltips.
- Fedora CI and release builds use Fedora's own image registry with bounded pull retries, avoiding Docker Hub anonymous rate limits; build failures remain visible.
- Clipboard delivery waits for wl-copy's selection acknowledgement instead of a fixed 500 ms delay. Successful clipboard owners survive closing Settings; failed attempts, including descendants, are cleaned up with a bounded timeout.

## 0.6.7 — 2026-10-10

- Model availability and download progress now follow the selected model and refresh after completion without restarting the UI.
- Unsaved settings are confirmed before leaving; saving respects language changes, window closure and later edits. Repeated actions and delayed replies are guarded.
- Fixed graceful PipeWire recording completion and improved recovery and preparation feedback.
- Added first-dictation preparation guidance, draft-only recognition presets and an optional compact status indicator.
- Diagnostic reports are previewed before sharing and saved asynchronously with intact UTF-8 contents and private file permissions.
- Added Fedora 44 RPM builds, architecture checks and SHA-256 checksums to CI and releases alongside Debian packages.
- Removed unused UI scaffolding and retained behavioral regression checks. Live microphone, insertion and RPM desktop-installation scenarios still require validation on target desktops.

## 0.6.6 — 2026-10-09

- Decomposed the settings UI into pages and owned controllers; background replies respect window lifetime.
- Fixed recorder and ASR cleanup, startup rollback, cancellation, shutdown and worker recovery after timeouts or lost connections. A worker disappearing before a request permits safe one-shot fallback.
- Local recognition requires complete offline model snapshots; model preparation uses the explicitly selected target without saving unrelated draft settings.
- Daemon readiness is confirmed after service startup; failed recovery retries are bounded. Repeated desktop-integration requests are combined and setup errors retain their cause.
- Dictation text is hidden in notifications by default, with an explicit opt-in setting. Removed compute-type keys that never affected recognition.
- Native setup and Flatpak share pinned runtime dependencies compatible with Python 3.11. Debian builds use source timestamps and stop on compiler errors; Python wheels include the runtime dependency file.
- Removed redundant tests while retaining behavioral regression checks. Full Flatpak build and passive imports were verified; live microphone, shortcut and insertion scenarios remain to be validated on target desktops.


## 0.6.5 — 2026-10-07

- CI and release runs at the 0.6.4 commit were red: a new test class carried no skip guard for machines without GTK bindings and errored instead of skipping. The class now skips like every other UI test, and the release gate runs the suite a second time with `gi` blocked, so the class of mistake fails the gate locally before it fails a release.
- The toast tests for daemon refusals no longer race the worker thread that carries the reply.
- A Hub model whose download helper is missing from a damaged install is reported as an error naming the repair (reinstall the package) instead of "this model cannot be downloaded", which hid the row and the button again.
- While the model loads into memory, the main window says "Preparing" rather than quoting a finished transfer at 100%.

## 0.6.4 — 2026-10-07

- **Fixed: the Download button silently did nothing when the Faster-Whisper runtime was not prepared.** The daemon answered "this model cannot be downloaded" — a statement about the model, not about the missing setup — and the window had no answer for it: the row and the button disappeared, no word explained the press. A missing runtime is now an error whose message says what to do (Settings or `wayvoice engine-setup`), the failed row stays visible, the button returns for the same model, and a synchronous refusal from the daemon appears as a toast. A local folder keeps its quiet "not downloadable" subtitle.
- **Fixed: the main window kept saying "Press and speak" while the model was being downloaded or loaded.** The settings window painted its progress row, but the hero invited a dictation the hot key could not serve yet — starting one answered "model missing". While the daemon fetches the weights the hero names the model and its progress (size, percent), and while they load into memory it says so; the pill reads "Preparing".

## 0.6.3 — 2026-10-06

- The Debian package declares the architecture it was built for (`amd64` and friends) instead of `all`, matching the ydotool binaries it bundles; release artifacts and CI assertions follow the new `wayvoice_<version>_<arch>.deb` naming. CI now also asserts the manifest structure of the Flatpak build (its full build remains a manual, networked validation), and `make lint` checks real shell files again.
- A malformed `max_recording_sec` is now reported even when the recognition engine is not prepared: the setting is validated before any engine or model preflight, instead of being masked behind «Faster-Whisper is not prepared».
- Clarification on the 0.6.2 note below: the release workflow *does* create the tag when publishing from a push to `main` (via the release action, with `commitish` pinning the commit); what it no longer does is push the tag with `GITHUB_TOKEN` from a workflow step — which is why workflows were never triggered by that push. Pushing the tag yourself remains the alternative path; both converge on the same commit.
- **Fixed: the ydotool helper restarted itself every two seconds on a package built without a compiler.** The unit's condition only checks that the wrapper is on `PATH`, and the wrapper is installed either way — it explains that the bundled binary is missing and exits 1, which `Restart=on-failure` treats as a crash. The wrapper now exits 78 (`EX_CONFIG`) and the unit does not restart that code, plus a start limit for any other permanent failure. Automatic paste keeps working the way it was designed to for such a package: through the clipboard.
- **Fixed: deleting a model could break another program's model.** Three ways, all reported as success. The branch that keeps files another model links to compared the entries of the model's `blobs/` directory against the blob paths it was asked to keep — and a blob lives at `blobs/<2 hex>/<name>`, so the entries are the two-hex directories and the comparison never matched: it deleted the very files whose purpose was to protect them, while reporting their size as kept. A model whose snapshot keeps real subdirectories (`onnx/` and the like) had its shared blobs treated as unreferenced, because the snapshot was read one level deep. And with a symlink anywhere on the cache path — `HF_HUB_CACHE=~/models-hf` on another disk is an ordinary setup — the two sides of every comparison were different kinds of path, so the model being deleted counted as somebody else's and the answer said «0 B freed» after freeing everything.
- **Fixed: «Скопировать журнал» froze the window for as long as `journalctl` took** — up to the full five-second timeout, because it ran inside the click handler. It reads the journal on a thread now, like the other three buttons.
- **Fixed: long messages were never clipped in a toast.** The clipping lived in a *second* `_toast` defined earlier in the window class, which the later definition silently replaced — so a refusal quoting a package manager's output stretched across the whole window, since a toast does not wrap.
- **Fixed: two dependencies could be installed at the same time, and the second one lost.** The window guards only against installing the same dependency twice, so clicking Install on two different missing dependencies ran two package managers at once and the loser failed with `Unable to acquire dpkg frontend lock`. Installs now hold a lock between processes, released by the kernel if one dies.
- **Fixed: a package that asked a question during install hung until the timeout.** The manager inherited the terminal and the process locale, and nothing said `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`, so a maintainer script's debconf prompt waited for an answer nobody could type - and was then killed mid-`dpkg`. The output tail was also shown in the system's language inside an interface string in the user's language; it is now read in the C locale like the availability check already was.
- **Fixed: `Ctrl-C` during `wayvoice deps --install` left the package manager running.** It is started in its own session, so the interrupt never reached it, and it went on holding the dpkg lock against every later attempt. The tree is now killed on the way out, including on an interrupt - and the kill follows the whole process group: `dpkg` ignores `SIGTERM`, so waiting for the direct child to exit and stopping there left it alive with the lock.
- **Fixed: installing dependencies installed nothing when one of them was missing from the repositories.** The check returned on the first unknown name, before the package manager was started, and "install everything missing" passes every dependency in one call - so on a system whose repositories carry no `ydotool` package, `pipewire-bin`, `wl-clipboard` and `libnotify-bin` stayed uninstalled and the only thing said aloud was `ydotool`. The unavailable names are now left out, the rest is installed, and the answer names both what was installed and what was not. "Cannot tell whether this package exists" is no longer treated as "does not exist", so an unrefreshed package index still gets tried.
- **Fixed: the application silently got much slower and stayed slower.** The warm worker could be left running with its socket unlinked - invisible, holding the model and gigabytes of RAM - after which every dictation loaded the model from scratch. For `large-v3` that is minutes instead of seconds, with no error anywhere. A stopped helper is now only cleaned up when nothing answers on its socket.
- **Fixed: one wrong value in `config.json` disabled model preparation for the rest of the session.** A `"beam_size": null` raised inside the preparation thread, which had no exception handler, so the flag saying "preparing" was never cleared: the settings button and `wayvoice model --download` were then refused until the daemon restarted, and the window's spinner turned over a download that was not happening. Every number read from the configuration now has a floor, and the thread clears its flags whatever happens - including a cancellation, which is a state of its own and not an error.
- **Fixed: the first dictation after installing never pasted.** The environment for the ydotool client was built before the helper was raised, and `YDOTOOL_SOCKET` is only set when a socket already exists - so the first dictation had no socket path at all and the client looked in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/.ydotool_socket`, which is not where the packaged helper listens. From the second dictation on it worked.
- **Fixed: a system with its own ydotoold got a second one fighting it for `/dev/uinput`.** Only the packaged socket path and `/tmp` were searched; a distribution's `ydotoold` listens in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/.ydotool_socket`, so the helper looked absent and one was started behind it. All three locations are now searched, in the order the client itself would.
- **Fixed: every dictated number, time, version, address, file name and e-mail came out mangled.** The punctuation pass inserted a space after every full stop and comma, and the capitalizer read the same full stops as sentence ends: `цена 3.5 евро` became `Цена 3. 5 евро.`, `встреча в 12:30` became `Встреча в 12: 30.`, `версия 1.2.3` became `Версия 1. 2. 3.`, and `https://example.com/page` became `https: //example. Com/page.`. The pass runs on every dictation, because automatic punctuation is on by default. Both steps now work per token and leave a token alone when its punctuation belongs to the token - with a known file extension as the rule that tells `отчёт.pdf` (one word) from `конец.начало` (two words the recognizer ran together, which is what the pass exists to fix). No test had a digit, a colon or a dot in it until now.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-10-05

- The Debian package now ships its own `ydotool`, built from vendored sources, so automatic pasting works on distributions that do not package it — Debian 13 has none, in any component. A system's own copy is always preferred, the bundled one is a fallback, and a package built without a compiler simply has none.
- Licence changed from GPL-3.0-only to **AGPL-3.0-or-later**, which is what allows the automatic-paste helper to be shipped with the application: `ydotool` is AGPL-3.0-or-later, and its source cannot be combined with GPL-3.0-only code. Updated accordingly: LICENSE, packaging metadata, AppStream data, the About dialog, and a machine-readable `copyright` file in the package (Debian policy 12.5).
- Missing dependencies are detected before anything is installed, and a package the system's repositories do not carry is reported as such: the settings no longer offer a button that ends in “Unable to locate package” after an authorization dialog and a password prompt. Debian 13 has no `ydotool` package in any component, and the query that finds this out is made in the C locale, because apt translates its output.
- Publishing is one step now: a push to `main` that changes the version publishes the release, and so does a push of the tag `v*` for whoever prefers tags. A version that is in the tree but was never released — the forgotten tag — is published by the next push, and a push that changes nothing stays quiet. The workflow no longer creates the tag itself — it used to push with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and GitHub never starts workflows from such a push, so the tag appeared on the remote with nothing having run and a later `git push` of the same tag answered “Everything up-to-date”. A push to `main` that does not change the version does nothing at all.
- Automatic pasting works again after installing the package into a session that was already open. The `ydotool` helper unit is *enabled* at installation time, but a session that was up when the package arrived does not start a newly enabled unit until the next login — so dictation was recognized and then not pasted, with nothing in any log. The daemon now raises the helper itself when nothing answers on its socket, at most once a minute, and asks nobody to run `systemctl`.
- A failed paste now says why. `ydotool` reports its errors on **stdout**, which was sent to `/dev/null`, so the one line naming the cause — `failed to connect socket …: No such file or directory` — was discarded before anyone could read it and the user was left with “ydotool exited with an error”. The reason is kept, and every failure is written to the service log, so “it does not paste” is a line in `journalctl --user -u wayvoice` rather than something to be described from memory.
- Notifications no longer pile up: one dictation passes through three states (recording, transcribing, done) and each of them used to arrive as its own popup, so the notification center filled with three lines per dictation. Each dictation now owns one entry and the states update it in place, while the recognized text stays in the history until the next dictation starts — overwriting it would have been the other half of the same mistake.
- **Fixed: quitting during a dictation deleted the audio out from under the recognizer.** The shutdown path cancelled the recorder - which unlinks the file `stop_to_wav()` had handed to the transcription thread - and only then set the cancel flag. `quit`, SIGTERM or SIGHUP mid-dictation produced `FileNotFoundError` in `last_error` and in a notification, where the user should have seen a cancelled recognition. A file that has been handed out is the caller's to delete now; the stale-recording sweeper covers the case where its owner died first.
- **Fixed: an unlink failure could leave the daemon refusing every dictation for the rest of the session.** `missing_ok=True` covers exactly one exception and the state reset sat after the unlink, so a `PermissionError` there escaped the `finally` and `busy` stayed set - the hot key answered “recognition is still running” until the daemon was restarted. The reset comes first and the unlink can no longer raise into it.
- **Fixed: a non-numeric `max_recording_sec` opened the microphone with no limit at all.** The limit was parsed *after* the recorder started, so the `ValueError` arrived with `pw-record` already holding the device and no timer to close it; the next keypress then transcribed minutes of room noise. The value is now read before anything starts, the refusal names the setting, and the auto-stop timer falls back to the default instead of dying.
- **Fixed: a full command queue could leave the socket file behind on shutdown.** `put_nowait(None)` is the one line of the exit path that can fail, and the enqueue path handles that case explicitly while the exit path did not.
- **Fixed: no model could be downloaded from the settings window.** The window compared the model store's `kind` against `"hub"`, a value nothing produces - the store answers `"repo"`, `"local"` or `"custom"`. So choosing any model from the hub offered no download button at all and asked no permission, leaving only "Delete", which is what was reported for Large v3 Russian. The three kinds are now named constants in `model_store`, and the tests ask `describe()` for a real answer instead of spelling the vocabulary out: the fixtures had the same wrong string as the code, which is why the suite was green.
- **Fixed: a test of mine broke CI.** Two new tests read `ui.__file__` outside the guard that skips when the GTK bindings are missing, so the unit-test job - which has no `python3-gi` - failed on a `None`. They locate the file with `importlib.util.find_spec`, which does not import the module, so the checks run on CI instead of skipping.
- **Fixed: every successful dictation ended in a red error state.** The notification that announces the result was called with three positional arguments where `notify(title, body, *, enabled, replace)` takes two, so Python raised `TypeError` *after* the text had been recognised and inserted. The worker's catch-all handler stored it as `last_error`, and the window showed a failure for a dictation that had worked. Present since the first release commit; it survived because no test drove the one path that reaches it, and because a test that mocks `notify()` cannot see it - a mock accepts any arguments.
- **Fixed: “Copy diagnostics” copied nothing.** It wrote to `Gdk.Display.get_default().get_clipboard()`, the GTK3 clipboard, which on Wayland accepts the text and never offers it, and then reported success. The report now goes through the same `wl-copy` path the dictation itself uses, and a clipboard that refuses is reported instead of toasted as success.
- **Fixed: “Open logs” opened nothing.** The button showed a toast containing a `journalctl` command and called that a feature. It now reads the last 200 lines of the daemon journal and puts them in the clipboard, which is what a bug report needs, and it says so when the journal is empty, unreadable or missing.
- The whisper.cpp engine tells the program how many threads it may use. whisper.cpp defaults to four, and that default was the reason the engine looked slow: measured on the same laptop and the same twelve seconds of speech, a medium model took 21.8 s with the default and 12.5 s with the thread count of the machine. Nothing else had changed.
- The helper is asked whether it is *listening*, not whether its socket file exists. `ydotoold` is killed without cleaning up, so a socket left behind by a dead helper looks exactly like a working one — the check that says “nothing answers” is now a `connect()` to the socket, which the kernel refuses for a socket nobody serves.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-10-04

- Automatic pasting on distributions that do not package `ydotool`: the helper is built from vendored sources and shipped with the package, and a distribution's own copy is still preferred. Licence changed from GPL-3.0-only to **AGPL-3.0-or-later**.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-04

- Recognition languages: all 100 that Whisper supports, each under its own name, with automatic detection as the default instead of a pinned language.
- Spoken punctuation commands in English as well as Russian, applied per language.
- Engine registry: engines are declared once and the window, the daemon and the CLI all ask it, instead of three places comparing engine ids.
- External command engine is now reachable from the settings window.
- Model management: size on disk, free space, the whole shared cache, and deletion that keeps files another model still uses.
- Daemon, engine and hot key now start without systemd, so the Flatpak build works.
- Faster-Whisper model is kept warm between dictations, and is loaded into memory when the daemon starts so the first dictation of a session is as fast as the ones after it.
- Model downloads are a visible, cancellable step with progress in bytes, instead of a silent wait inside the first recognition.
- Choosing a model asks before the download: a model that is already on disk is only loaded, one that is not is fetched after the user says so, and the question names the model and its size.
- Preparing a model that is already on disk loads it into the warm worker, so the first dictation after choosing it is as fast as the ones after that, and the settings window says so instead of showing nothing.
- A missing model can be fetched from the settings window itself: the model row grows a Download button, instead of the only way to fetch one being to pick a different model first.
- The hot key no longer starts a model download on its own. Pressing it is not agreeing to spend the bandwidth, so it now says which model is missing and where it can be fetched.
- The warm-up message no longer promises a time: a large model on a slow disk takes minutes to load, and the row says it is waiting instead of guessing.
- Installation paths are prefix-independent.
- New application icon, and the desktop entry declares one main category, so the app appears once in the menu.
- A model given as a local path is dictatable again: it was being reported as "missing", which made the daemon refuse every hot key press and offer a download that cannot succeed.
- Downloading a model no longer raises errors from inside `huggingface_hub` on the xet-served path, and the download progress is still exact.
- Stopping the daemon now stops the recording with it. Only a signal used to end the process outright, skipping the cleanup, so the recorder - which runs in a session of its own - stayed behind holding the microphone with nobody left to stop it. That is what systemd sends on stop, and what a forced stop sends to a daemon that ignored `quit`.
- The daemon keeps answering while it works: a slow notification or a slow command no longer make the settings window decide the daemon has died and the hot key do nothing.
- The warm-up reports what actually happened: it no longer gives up and calls a model "not loaded" while it is still being read, and a model being loaded counts as work, so the worker is no longer timed out and exits mid-load.
- Ownership is decided before anything is prepared, so a second daemon that is going to be refused no longer stops the running daemon's worker.
- Every message WayVoice writes for the user is translated, including download failures, cancellation and the refusals the command line prints. Messages from `huggingface_hub` stay in the library's own language.
- Two file handles per dictation are closed on the way out instead of whenever the collector gets round to it.
- Flatpak build asks for network access, without which the model download cannot work inside the sandbox at all.
- Robustness: the daemon survives a silent or oversized client, and a second daemon can no longer take its socket over; a failed notification no longer aborts a recording or throws away a finished transcript; the clipboard copy and the recorder have deadlines and clean up after themselves; a cancelled dictation is no longer typed anyway; a config that cannot be parsed is reported instead of silently replaced by the defaults; a hung package install no longer leaves `dpkg` locked; `setup-user` reports a hotkey it could not apply.
