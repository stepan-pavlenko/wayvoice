"""The daemon has to answer while it is doing something else.

The accept loop serves one client at a time, and the settings window asks for
the status every 650 ms with a timeout of 0.12 s.  So anything the loop does
inline is a window of time in which the window decides the daemon is dead,
disables the microphone button and says "starting" - and the hot key, which
allows 1.5 s, silently does nothing.

Two things used to make that window seconds wide: the desktop notification, a
subprocess with a five second deadline, was sent inline while the daemon held
its own lock; and every command was dispatched on the loop itself, so a
``stop_recording`` that waits for the recorder to flush took the whole daemon
with it.

The tests below pin the design rather than an implementation: ``ping`` and
``status`` are answered on the loop, everything else is handed to one worker,
and a notification is never waited for.
