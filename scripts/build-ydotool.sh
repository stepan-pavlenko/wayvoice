#
# It is a separate step because a compiler is not always here: the package is
# still built without it, and automatic paste falls back to the clipboard, which
# is what the application says it does when the helper is missing. The sources
# are vendored under third_party/ydotool; see the README there for why, for the
# licence, and for which upstream revision they are.
#
# Two programs, no dependencies beyond libc, so this is a compiler invocation and
# not a build system. Downstream safety changes are documented with the sources.
