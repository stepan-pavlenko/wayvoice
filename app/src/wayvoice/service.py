"""Single place that decides how this system starts the WayVoice parts.

The Debian package drives everything through ``systemctl --user``. A Flatpak build
has no ``systemctl`` and the host user manager cannot see ``/app``, so every one of
those calls fails and the daemon, the engine preparation and the shortcut are never
applied. Both shapes end up behind one API: with a user manager, keep using the
units; without one, do the same work directly.

Only the standard library is used, nothing runs through a shell, and every entry
point is best effort - the callers (the GTK window, the daemon, the CLI) all swallow
failures.

:mod:`wayvoice.cli` is imported lazily inside the functions that need it: it imports
:mod:`wayvoice.engine`, which imports this module.
